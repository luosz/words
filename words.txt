Sitting in a sound anatomic position is essential, since the strain put on the spine and its associated ligaments over time can lead to pain, deformity and chronic illness.

In general, opening up the angle between the trunk and the thighs in a seated posture is a good idea and it will improve the shape of the spine, making it more like the natural S-shape in a standing posture.

As to what is the best angle between thigh and torso when seated, reclining at 135 degrees can make sitting more difficult as there is a tendency to slide off the seat: 120 degrees or less may be better.

Miss Shen, where is Chang Neng-tsai hiding?
He killed my husband. He must die for it.
Miss Shen, here I come.
Hoonlians. Go away.
If she doesn't turn him in, we'll be back everyday.
Don't catch cold.
Are the beans fresh?
Shao-hua, you are here.
Don't worry. I was followed.
I don't mean that.
My landlady. She does my coking and laundry.
She takes care of me.
I didn't ask.
Let's buy some cloth.
How much for one foot of cloth.
You need at least 8 feet for a short-sleeve dress.
Don't worry. I will give a good price.
How much should I cut?
We'll come back.
Never mind.
I want a thimble and some red thread.
They're hard to find in the city. Get them for me.
How long will you stay?
I've moved all my things here.
It's late. Where are you going?
I'll be at my brother's for a few days.
You fool.
How can you say the same thing to her?
What did I say?
You fool.
You always said this when you hold me in your arms.
What does it matter?
She is only my landlady.
Did you tell her the same about me?
No.
She's nothing compared to you.
Do you know why I am here?
Because I love you.
But since I arrived, you've said nothing about love.
You call me unfair, and compare me with other women.
I love only you, but there are other women in your life.
I don't need you or anyone else to shelter me from the rain.
Jade Orchid fell ill. She and Spring Hope finally married.
He took her home, to be looked after by his mother.
Then he joined the army.
He said: Men must die for their country.
She said: I'll always be your wife while I am alive, when I'm dead.
Are you wet?
I'm going to the meeting.
Open your mouth.
A dog must have eaten his heart.

Are you getting married.
No. We'll put a nail here, a nail there. Hang up the sheet and divide the room into two.
To keep you away from us.
Stay home. Don't get into trouble.
He asked me to go.
He wanted me to go.
When a woman is in love, nothing is more dangerous.
Don't you agree?
Whatever happens is our own doing.
The school was surrounded. The students tried to break out and the police opened fire.
There's nothing there anymore.
I've to look for her.
I told you to stay out of trouble.
Minister Chang, how have you been?
How much does it cost to eat there now?
Nothing is the same anymore.
What has become of you?
Where are you going?
At least I'm still alive.
Your first words are still about yourself.
Ever think about Yueh-feng and me?
Yueh-feng didn't stay alive. She's dead.
I cleaned her body, changed her clothes.
I filled thousands of bullet holes in her body, one by one with cotton.
I dug her grave with my hands.
Where were you then?
Here he is again. Let's go inside.
After years of poverty and self-exile, no one ask about my past anymore.
When the political situation has relaxed, I returned to the place that has haunted me to find the person who has haunted me.
Mr Change, our superior is waiting.
How are you? Please come in.
As requested in your letter, we've found the dossier on Shen Shao-hua.
Just a minute.
Comrade, I want to apply for residence.

Sisyphus  
Sis·y·phus

Each time he got near to the top of the hill, the stone rolled down to the bottom, and he had to start again, and he had to continue doing this for ever. A very difficult job that seems impossible to finish is sometimes described as a 'Sisyphean task'.
